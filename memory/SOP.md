# SOP - Living Operating Procedure

## Purpose

This document is the shared, living Standard Operating Procedure for LLM agent behavior in this workspace.

All agents must:

1. Read this file at session start.
2. Understand current procedures before taking action.
3. Update this file when workflow rules, safeguards, or repeatable practices change.

## Session Start SOP

1. Read `.tom-workspace/AGENTS.md`.
2. Read this file (`memory/SOP.md`).
3. Confirm current mission context from active docs/memory files.
4. Execute work using the least risky path that satisfies requirements.
5. Record meaningful procedural updates back into this SOP.

## Change Control

- Keep updates concise and operational.
- Prefer small edits over large rewrites.
- Preserve intent of prior validated procedures unless explicitly superseded.
- When replacing a procedure, include a short rationale in the update.
